# Platformer Dash
There is my own game Platformer Dash created on Clickteam.
# The game is dead...
This date, October 1, 2023, is the official date of death of this game... R.I.P.
# The game is came back!
As some of you already knew, on October 1, 2023, I broke my computer, which caused me to lose the entire project (the so-called source code) of the game, and so, on April 2, 2024, with the help of a decompiler, I made a project from the finished latest version of the game and began to develop 0.4. Finally, this game is came back!
# The project of the game.
I apologize to everyone who was waiting for the release of the game. I couldn't make it due to lack of ideas and interest in development. I'm giving you a draft game, you can do whatever you want with it - sequels, mods, you can completely redesign the game, I don't mind, on the contrary, I'll even be glad if you do something worthwhile.
